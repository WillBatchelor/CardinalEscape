* Resources
Anything that is a *thing* is a resource.

Some truths about resources:

- They either exist somewhere on the map, or they are "held" by the avatar
- There is a finite number of resources. They exist in exactly one place.
- All resources can be "applied" to other resources, or map locations. Stuff
may or may not happen

Essentially, these are doubly linked lists. All resources are allocated at
runtime, and then they are assigned to be specific items and things. Resources
are "stacked" on top of one and another.
