* Input
This section will discuss how input in Cardinal Escape is handled. Input
events come exclusively from keyboard input.
The input hanlder will handle every incoming key press from the keyboard,
and then do some action based on what key was pressed and the current game
state. Any action will change the game state in some way. When the game
state is changed, the display will update as well. As a result, the movement
of time in the game is driven exclusively by the user input. This is a game
design pattern adopted from Rogue-like games.
