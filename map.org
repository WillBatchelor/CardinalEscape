* The Map
This section will outline the overall map of the Cardinal Escape game.
The map is the world our player will navigate, discover, and change in order
to escape. Conceptually, the world is a rectangular grid composed of tiles.
At any given point in time, our hero is on exactly one tile.
** The Tile
To start things off, we will consider the Tile: the smallest component of the
map.
What are some things we want to do with a tile?
- Walk onto it
- Have stuff happen when you walk onto it
- Have stuff happen when you do something to it when you press it
- Have items stored on it
- Have states/switches stored on it
- Be able to print messages
** The Grid
The grid is a collection of Tiles. This is a fixed amount of tiles statically
allocated. The foundation of the grid creates the map.
